## Trends in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (BIDA)

### Conceptual Model (Simple Linear Regression)

- Treat **data volume, velocity, and variety** as independent variable `x`.
- Treat the **BIDA field (and its professionals)** as dependent variable `y`.
- Assume:
  - Present-day data characteristics = starting point `a`
  - Growth rate (slope `b`) is **positive**
  - Error term `ε` = variation in `y` not explained by `x`

#### Linear Model:
`y = bx + a + ε`

- If `b > 0`, then as data grows, BIDA grows too.
- Based on industry data, growth in `y` is **"very positive"**.
