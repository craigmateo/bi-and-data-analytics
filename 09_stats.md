## ðŸ§  Key Terms and Concepts

- **Correlation**  
  A measure of the strength of the relationship between two variables.

- **Covariance**  
  A measure of the relationship between two variables, without estimating the strength of the relationship.

- **Discretization**  
  Transforming numeric attributes to nominal.

- **Distributions**  
  An arrangement of the values of a variable that shows their observed or theoretical frequency of occurrence.

- **Mean**  
  The average value in a dataset.

- **Percentiles**  
  A value indicative of the rank of a score relative to other scores in a dataset.

- **Qualitative Analysis**  
  A data analysis technique that involves analyzing data that are subjective and not numerical.

- **Quantitative Analysis**  
  A data analysis technique that uses statistical methods to summarize the features of a dataset, or to generalize from it to a larger population.

- **Standard Deviation**  
  A descriptive statistic that shows the degree to which data points are dispersed around the mean.

- **Supervised Discretization**  
  Taking class into account when making discretization decisions.

## Data Analysis

- **Quantitative Analysis:**  
  Uses statistical methods to summarize data and generalize to populations. Involves numerical data collected in large samples.

- **Qualitative Analysis:**  
  Analyzes non-numerical, subjective data (e.g., color, gender, taste). Results usually cannot be generalized due to small samples.

- **Statistical Analysis:**  
  Uses mathematical formulas to analyze data. Types of statistical data:  
  - Numerical (Discrete & Continuous)  
  - Categorical (qualitative groups)  
  - Ordinal (ranked categories with meaningful numbers)

- **Learning Activity Examples:**  
  - Gas purchased: Numerical, continuous  
  - Hair color: Categorical  
  - Pay bands (A, B, C, D): Ordinal

- **Statistic:**  
  Data from part of a population; used to produce meaningful information (mean, median, mode).

- **Normal Distribution:**  
  Bell curve shaped by mean (center) and standard deviation (spread). Small deviation â†’ steep curve; large deviation â†’ flat curve.

## Descriptive Statistics

- **Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics:**  
  - Descriptive: Summarizes sample data features without making predictions.  
  - Inferential: Makes predictions about a population from a sample (covered in module 10).

- **Key Descriptive Statistics:**  
  - **Mean:** Average value (sum Ã· count).  
    *Example:* Mean of 10, 6, 20 = (10 + 6 + 20) / 3 = 12  
  - **Mode:** Most frequent value.  
    *Example:* Mode of 21, 21, 21, 23, 24, 26 = 21  
  - **Median:** Middle value in ordered data.  
    *Example:* Median of 23, 24, 26, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33 = 28  
  - **Range:** Difference between max and min values.  
    *Example:* Range of 7 to 99 = 99 - 7 = 92  
  - **Variance:** Average of squared differences from the mean (measures spread).  
  - **Standard Deviation:** Square root of variance; shows data dispersion around the mean.  
    - Low SD: data close to mean  
    - High SD: data spread out

- **Skewness:**  
  - Measures asymmetry of data distribution.  
  - **Skewed left (negative):** Long left tail; mean < peak.  
  - **Skewed right (positive):** Long right tail; mean > peak.

- **Other terms:**  
  - **Count:** Total number of values.  
  - **Maximum:** Highest value.  
  - **Minimum:** Lowest value.

- **Use:** Descriptive analytics explain past events and causes, often applied in sales, marketing, finance, and operations.

## Percentiles

- Percentiles indicate relative standing in a dataset (range 0â€“100).
- To calculate the kth percentile:  
  1. Order data from smallest to largest.  
  2. Multiply k by total number of values â†’ index.  
  3. If index is not whole, round up and select that value.  
  4. If index is whole, average the value at index and the next value.  
- Percentiles show the value below which a given percentage of data falls.  
  - Example: 90th percentile means 90% of scores are below that value.

## Covariance

- Measures how two variables change together (direction of relationship).  
- Positive covariance: variables move in the same direction.  
- Negative covariance: variables move in opposite directions.  
- Does **not** measure strength or dependency of the relationship.  
- Calculated by multiplying units of the two variables; values can be positive or negative.  
- Important in finance for portfolio diversification to minimize risk by selecting assets with low positive covariance.

## Correlation

Correlation builds on covariance by measuring **both the direction and strength** of the relationship between variables.

- **Covariance** shows direction only.
- **Correlation** scales covariance and is **dimensionless**.
- A **correlation coefficient (r)** ranges from:
  - `+1`: Perfect positive correlation.
  - `-1`: Perfect negative correlation.
  - `0`: No correlation.

The **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** is the most commonly used and assumes a **linear relationship** between variables.

### Interpretation of r values:

- The **absolute value** of r shows the **strength** of the relationship.
  - Example: |âˆ’0.75| = 0.75 â†’ stronger than 0.65.

### Important Notes:

- **Correlation does not imply causation**.
  - A third variable (confounding factor) may be influencing both.
- In business, correlation is used to:
  - Enhance processes.
  - Reduce costs.
  - Support data-driven decisions.
  - Handle uncertainty and risk.
